## Welcome to our official README
### Purpose
This is a general website to compile a couple of the great things about Victor Torres. At first, there may not be much, but in time, we will see what time brings. 

### Structure
There is a general file structure with index, about, portfolio, style.css and javascript.js all in the same folder. The images are in their own folder. 

### License
Currently no license has been selected. This possibly could change in the future.
